What is it?
------------

It is a revamped version of [Mack Media Group](https://mackmediagroup.com/)'s Homepage built specifically using [`Google AMP`](https://www.ampproject.org/). 

**It was styled only for mobile devices, so viewing it on displays larger than the width of a smart-phone or tablet *is not recommended*.**

The project uses a relatively new piece of technology curated by [Google](http://google.com) called **Google Accelerated-Mobile-Pages (AMP)**.

As described by Google below, *Google AMP* is:

*"The AMP Project is an open-source initiative aiming to make the web better for all. The project enables the creation of websites and ads that are consistently fast, beautiful and high-performing across devices and distribution platforms.(https://www.ampproject.org/)"*

During my internship at *Mack Media*, I learned the process that goes into making a website from start to finish and the various methods that professionals use to get a client's brand out by using different SEO techniques. I was the lead developer of the AMP website conversion, where I used Google AMP pages to develop a user-friendly and wickedly fast new home page for the agency.
